# DCG Main Title Editor
-----------------------

## Description

*DCG Main Title Editor* advises to customize own main title of *DCG(Destiny Child Game)*. This tool helps change some values of the main title mvd file. Any character's .mvd files can be usable (maybe), and any character you want (including spa skin also!) can be set. It is possible to change the size and position of character, and the stage background also can change using files in *files\stage\stage_bg* folder.


## Usage

1. Get any *main_title_******.mvd* file. (in *Android\com.NextFloor.DestinyChild\files\ux\title* folder on *Android OS*)
2. Execute *"DCG Main Title Editor.exe"*, and open .mvd file.
3. Change character number, background stage, x/y coordinate, x/y scale as you want, and apply to save new file.
4. Move the result on your machine, and check the result on the game.
5. Repeat 3~4 until you are satisfied.
